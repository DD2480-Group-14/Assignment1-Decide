# DECIDE: A Launch Intercepter Program

A group implementation of the DECIDE() function which determines interceptor launch signals based on radar tracking data.

## Description 
The program evaluates up to 100 planar data points, representing radar echoes, against fifteen *Launch Interceptor Conditions* (LICs) to form a *Condition Met Vector* (CMV). By combining these results with an input *Logical Connector Matrix* (LCM) and an input *Preliminary Unlocking Vector* (PUV), the program calculates a *Final Unlocking Vector* (FUV) to generate a final "YES" or "NO" launch decision.
